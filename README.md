# Client-Server-application (Remote Health System)

A client-server application is a popular software design architecture that breaks   
software down abstractly into client and server components. 

•	A client-side application (or simply client) runs on the end-user computer; it provides the user-interface (UI) 
that handles how the application feels, looks like, and interacts with end-user. The application may consume temporary and local storage on the user's computer (computer device).

•	In server-side applications, requests are received from clients, and logic is used to return appropriate data to the clients. 
Application programming interfaces (APIs) are usually used instead of user interfaces. Moreover, the server often includes a database,
which stores all application data permanently.
